# Spring Boot Logging with Actuators

This Spring Boot project demonstrates how actuators can be used to modify class-level logging levels at runtime.

## Project Details

- **Spring Boot Version:** 3.2.4
- **JDK Version:** JDK 17

## Project Structure

The project follows the package structure `dev.knowledgecafe.springlogging` and includes the following classes:

1. `HomeController`: Contains a `/home` GET endpoint that returns a "Hello, world!" string.
2. `SpringLoggingApplication`: The main class that starts the Spring Boot application.

## Logging Example

In the `HomeController`, there are logging statements at different log levels before the return statements. This is done to showcase how logging levels can be managed using Spring Boot actuators.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Ensure you have JDK 17 installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the main class `SpringLoggignApplication`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the `/home` endpoint to see the "Hello, world!" message. Additionally, you can use Spring Boot actuators to modify the logging levels dynamically.
